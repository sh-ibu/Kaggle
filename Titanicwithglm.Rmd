## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
### Loading Necessary Packages


```{r message = FALSE}
# For data manipulation and tidying
library(dplyr)

# For data visualizations
library(ggplot2)

# For modeling and predictions
library(caret)
library(glmnet)
library(ranger)
library(e1071)
```

```{r}
train=read.csv('Titanic Train.csv')
test=read.csv('Titanic Test.csv')
train$Dataset <- "train"
test$Dataset <- "test"
full=bind_rows(train,test)
str(full)
factor_variables = c('PassengerId', 'Survived', 'Pclass', 'Sex','Embarked','Dataset')
full[factor_variables] = lapply(full[factor_variables], function(x) as.factor(x))
```

We are now left with the following variables:

* **Passenger ID** : A seemingly unique number assigned to each passenger

* **Survived** : A binary indicator of survival (0 = died, 1 = survived)

* **Pclass** : A proxy for socio-economic status (1 = upper, 3 = lower)

* **Name** : Passenger's Name. For wedded women, her husband's name appears first and her maiden name appears in parentheses

* **Sex** : General indication of passenger's sex

* **Age** : Age of passenger (or approximate age).  Passengers under the age of 1 year have fractional ages

* **SibSp** : A count of the passenger's siblings or spouses aboard

* **Parch** : A count of the passenger's parents or siblings aboard

* **Ticket** : The number printed on the ticket.  The numbering system is not immediately apparent

* **Fare** : The price for the ticket (presumably in pounds, shillings, and pennies)

* **Cabin** : Cabin number occupied by the passenger (this field is quite empty)

* **Embarked** : The port from which the passenger boarded the ship

* **Dataset** : Whether this particular row was a part of the training or testing dataset

## Feature Engineering

### Names and Titles

At first glance, the "Name" column doesn't help too much as there are 1307 unique names, however, this column also includes embedded title information that may be of interest.  I decided to use [regular expressions](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf) and the `gsub()` functions to extract the titles into a new variable.

```{r}
names <- full$Name

titles <-  gsub("^.*, (.*?)\\..*$", "\\1", names)

full$Titles <- titles

unique(full$Titles)
```

That's a bit more manageable: only 18 unique titles. Time to see how many times each title was used.  I decided to make a table separated by sex. 

```{r}
table(full$Sex, full$Title)
```


```{r}
table(full$Pclass, full$Titles)
```

```{r}
full$Titles <- gsub("Dona|Lady|Madame|the Countess", "Lady", full$Titles)
full$Titles <- gsub("Don|Jonkheer|Sir", "Sir", full$Titles)

unique(full$Titles)
```



```{r}
full$Titles <- as.factor(full$Titles)
```


```{r}
full <- mutate(full, FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1)
```



```{r echo = FALSE}
hist(full$FamilySize, 
     main = "Family Group Size", 
     xlab = "People per Family Group", 
     col = "red",
     xlim = c(1,11),
     breaks = 11)
```
 
 
 
### Ticket Numbers and Travel Groups



```{r}
full$TravelGroup <- NA
```



```{r}
full2 <- arrange(full, Ticket)
```

```{r}
head(full2)
```



```{r}
full2 <- (transform(full2, TravelGroup = match(Ticket, unique(Ticket))))

# Can't forget to make those Travel Groups into factors!
full2$TravelGroup <- as.factor(full2$TravelGroup)
```


```{r}
full3 =full2 %>% 
            group_by(TravelGroup) %>% 
            mutate(GroupSize = n()) %>%
            ungroup()
```



```{r echo = FALSE, fig.show = 'hold', fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3.5}

hist(full3$FamilySize, 
     main = "Family Group Size", 
     xlab = "People per Family Group", 
     col = "#56B4E9",
     xlim = c(1,11),
     breaks = 11)
hist(full3$GroupSize, 
     main = "Travel Group Size", 
     xlab = "People per Travel Group", 
     col = "blue",
     xlim = c(1,11),
     breaks = 11)
```


```{r}
filtered <- filter(full3, GroupSize == 1)

fSibSp <- filtered[filtered$SibSp > 0, ]
nrow(fSibSp)


fParch <- filtered[filtered$Parch > 0, ]
nrow(fParch)

sum(fSibSp$PassengerId %in% fParch$PassengerId)
```


## Missing Data

```{r}
summary(full3)
```

. 

### Missing Fare

Which passenger has no fare information?
```{r}
full3[(which(is.na(full3$Fare))) , 1]
```

Looks like Passenger number 1044 has no listed Fare.  

```{r}
# Resort the dataset by Passenger Number
full4 <- arrange(full3, PassengerId)


full4[1044, c(3, 12)]
```

 he left from 'S' (Southampton) as a 3rd class passenger. we analyze what other people of the same class and embarkment port paid for their tickets. 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(full4[full4$Pclass == '3' & full$Embarked == 'S', ], 
  aes(x = Fare)) +
  geom_density(fill = '#56B4E9', alpha = 0.4) + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(Fare, na.rm = T)),
    colour = '#D55E00', linetype = 'dotted', lwd = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank())

```

```{r}
full4 %>%
  filter(Pclass == '3' & Embarked == 'S') %>%
  summarise(missing_fare = median(Fare, na.rm = TRUE))

```



```{r}
full4$Fare[1044] <- 8.05

summary(full4$Fare)
```

 
# Missing Embarkment


```{r}
full4$Embarked[full4$Embarked == ""] <- NA

full4[(which(is.na(full4$Embarked))), 1]
```


```{r}
full4[c(62, 830), c(1,3,10)]
```

```{r}
full4 %>%
  group_by(Embarked, Pclass) %>%
  filter(Pclass == "1") %>%
  summarise(mfare = median(Fare),
            n = n())
```

```{r}
# Assign empty embark ports to 'C'
full4$Embarked[c(62,830)] <- 'C'

# Drop unused levels (since there should be no more blanks)
full4$Embarked <- droplevels(full4$Embarked)

# Check to make sure there are no NA's or blanks
levels(full4$Embarked)
```

Yay! No more NA values for Embarked. 

### Missing Age


 
```{r results = 'hide'}
library(caret)
predicted_age <- train(
  Age ~ Pclass + Sex + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked + Titles + FamilySize + GroupSize,
  tuneGrid = data.frame(mtry = c(2, 3, 7)),
  data = full4[!is.na(full4$Age), ],
  method = "ranger",
  trControl = trainControl(
      method = "cv", number = 10,
      repeats = 10, verboseIter = TRUE),
  importance = 'impurity'
  )

```



```{r echo = FALSE}
# Creating a Variable Importance variable
 vimp <- varImp(predicted_age)

# Plotting "vimp"
 ggplot(vimp, 
        top = dim(vimp$importance)[1]
        )
```



```{r}
full4$Age[is.na(full4$Age)] <- predict(predicted_age, full4[is.na(full4$Age),])

# Check the summary to make sure there are no more NA values
summary(full4$Age)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.show = 'hold', fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3.5 }
hist(full3$Age, 
     main = "Known Age Distribution", 
     xlab = "Known Age", 
     col = "#56B4E9",
     breaks = 20)
hist(full4$Age,
     main = "Known + Predicted Age Distribution",
     xlab = "Known Age",
     col = "#D55E00",
     breaks = 20)
```



## Modeling for Survival



```{r}
train_complete <- full4[full4$Dataset == 'train', ]
test_complete <- full4[full4$Dataset == 'test', ]
```



### Creating trainControl
We use a system that will perform 10 repeats of a 10-Fold cross-validation of the data. 
```{r}
myControl <- trainControl(
	  method = "cv", 
	  number = 10,
	  repeats = 10, 
	  verboseIter = TRUE
  )
```

### Fitting a random forest model



```{r results = 'hide'}
rf_model <- train(
    Survived ~ Age + Pclass + Sex + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked + Titles + FamilySize + 
      TravelGroup + GroupSize,
    tuneGrid = data.frame(mtry = c(2, 5, 8, 10, 15)),
    data = train_complete, 
    method = "ranger", 
    trControl = myControl,
    importance = 'impurity'
)
```

### Fitting a glmnet model


```{r results = 'hide'}
glm_model <- train(
    Survived ~ Age + Pclass + Sex + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked + Titles + FamilySize + 
      TravelGroup + GroupSize, 
    method = "glmnet",
    tuneGrid = expand.grid(alpha = 0:1,
      lambda = seq(0.0001, 1, length = 20)),
    data = train_complete,
    trControl = myControl
)
```

### Comparing model fit

.  

```{r}
# Create a list of models
models <- list(rf = rf_model, glmnet = glm_model)

# Resample the models
resampled <- resamples(models)

# Generate a summary
summary(resampled)

# Plot the differences between model fits
dotplot(resampled, metric = "Accuracy")
```




## Predicting Survival


```{r}
# Reorder the data by Passenger ID number
test_complete <- test_complete %>%
                  arrange(PassengerId)

# Make predicted survival values
my_prediction <- predict(glm_model, test_complete)
```

### Preparing the prediction for Kaggle


```{r}
# Create a data frame with two columns: PassengerId & Survived where Survived contains my predictions.
my_solution_glm <- data.frame(PassengerID = test$PassengerId, Survived = my_prediction)

# Write the solution to a csv file 
write.csv(my_solution_glm, file = "my_solution_5.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
